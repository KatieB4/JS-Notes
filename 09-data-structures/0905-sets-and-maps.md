2023-04-21 1b sets are like arrays in that they have individual items, io key-value pairs, but different bc each element is unique, even if passed duplicates and order doesn't matter

2023-04-21 2 strings are also iterable, and so can be passed into a set

2023-04-21 4a this doesn't work- sets do not have indexes like arrays, so there is no way to get data out of a set. It's not necesary to get the data like an array because order doesn't matter and there are no duplicates, so the only thing to check is whether an item is in the set or not using the has method.
