## Destructuring Arrays and Objects

### 4/13/23
- destructure an array buy setting the variables you'd like to assign to each item in array equal to the array itself, note original array is still intact and accessible as well

- array items are matched to variables in order, skip an item by leaving a blank between commas

- clunkier method to switch array items by first reassigning to a temporary variable to store the value while switching

- easier method to switch placement-order of array items with destructuring by just reassigning

- create a method inside an object, then call that method, and access the arrays inside the object to create a new array

- destructure the array to assign variables to the individual array elements inside the object, allows you to receive more than one variable from just one function call

- use destructing to access nested array contents

- or destructure nested array at same time as parent array with additional square brackets
